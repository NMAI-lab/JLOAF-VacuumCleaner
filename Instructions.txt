How to Run jLOAF-VacuumCleaner

To run this project with your personal settings go to src/PerformanceTesting/Main.java and scroll to the main method.
Here there are 5 variables you can edit:
int mapNum1, mapNum2 - These represent the two maps you choose to compare against each other. Each map is represented with an unique integer

The next three data types are enumerators. If you don't know how to use an enumerator, read the next few lines:
  1. You must prefix the value you want with the DataType name, e.g. for a Integer DataType, you must write Integer.value.
  2. If you are using an IDE, you can type in the DataType. (DataType with a .) to see all the possible values the variable can take
  3. If you want an array of all the possible values to use, use the method DataType.values()
TestType testType - This represents which TestAgent you want to use.
Units[] - Choose one or several units you want to use. Since it must be an Array, put all you elements in between {} brackets.
Reasoners[] - Choose one or several Reasoners to use. 

After editing your variables, run the program. You will get a result file for every possible Unit and Reasoner combination you put into the program in the statistics and results directory. The results directory holds cvs files 
which stores a summary of your results, while the statistics directory holds txt files to be used to visualize what has happened.

Your file names are stored as such:
TestType - CBR,reasoner,none,none,unit,none - mapnum
e.g. ZigZagAgent - CBR,TB,none,none,kordered_r,none - m1
If you are looking at the txt file, the file name will also be prefixed with PredictedTraceFile.

How to Simulate the txt File
Download the LFO-Simulator and put it in the same workspace as jLOAF-VacuumCleaner. 
Then go to the src/lfo/experiments/TraceVisualizerFromTrace.java main method.
Change the txtFile and xmlFile variable to the name of the textFile/xmlFile you want to visualize. The xml files are in the traces folder, and the path you put in for the xml file push be starting from the Traces.
e.g. For Traces/zz/trace-m0-ZigZagAgent.txt, you must write zz/trace-m0-ZigZagAgent.txt. The TestType Agent and the map number must be the same for both the xml file and the txt file for the visualization to make sense.
Press run.
